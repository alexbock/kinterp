Exercise:

A program that computes the factorial of an integer (i.e. the product of
all integers up to and including that number).

0! = 1
1! = 1
2! = 1 * 2 = 2
3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120
etc. (the exclamation point means factorial)

Input:
Slot 0 is the integer whose factorial is to be computed
Output:
Slot 9 is the factorial of the input

Note that because of the step limit before the interpreter assumes an
infinite loop, you won't be able to calculate factorials beyond 6 or 7
before using too many steps.
