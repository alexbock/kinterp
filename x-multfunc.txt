Here's an example of reusable multiplication code. Lines that start with #
are comments and will be ignored. They're just there to explain what's
going on. This code uses the same multiplication routine to perform three
different multiplications. Note that subtracting a slot from itself is used
to set a slot to zero; setting a slot to zero and then adding to it is used
sometimes because there is no assignment instruction. (i.e. there's no
"set" or "asgn" opcode, so if you want to set the value instead of just
adding to it, you have to make it zero first)

# Reusable multiplication.
# Jump to L2 to invoke.
# Numbers to multiply go in
# slots 0 and 1. Result goes
# in slot 2. When done it will
# jump to the label in slot 3.
# Slots 0 and 1 will both have
# the value 0 afterward.
