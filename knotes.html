      <h1>The Kwama Programming Language</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Kwama is a very simple low level toy language. This is an example
        of a Kwama program:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @0 $10<br>
        :0<br>
        add @1 $3<br>
        sub @0 $1<br>
        cmp @0 $0<br>
        jne L0
      </div>

      <p>
        While this program looks strange, it uses every feature of the
        Kwama language! There is nothing novel beyond what you see here.
        We aren't going to focus on this example for the time being, but
        it will make sense later.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are going to start with the basic structure of the language.
        Every program consists of a list of <strong>instructions</strong> and
        may also contain <strong>labels</strong>. Each line is executed in sequence.
        Each instruction always occupies exactly one line. This is an example
        of an instruction:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @0 $5
      </div>

      <p>
        Each instruction has two parts: an <strong>opcode</strong> and its
        <strong>argument(s)</strong>. The opcode selects what operation is to
        be performed, and the arguments specify how or where it is performed.
        In the instruction above, the opcode is <span class="code">add</span>.
        The <span class="code">add</span> opcode requires two arguments. In the
        instruction above, the first argument is <span class="code">@0</span>
        and the second argument is <span class="code">$5</span>. Do not worry
        about what these numbers mean right now. The general form of an
        instruction is:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        opcode argument1 argument2 argument3 <span class="plain">(etc)</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        The <strong>only</strong> other kind of line is called a label. All
        lines are either instructions or labels. Labels start on a new line
        with a colon followed immediately by a number. In the following example,
        the first and last lines are instructions and the middle line is a label:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @2 @3 <br>
        :5 <br>
        cmp @3 $7 <br>
      </div>

      <p>
        We will discuss labels later.
      </p>

      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <p>
      A Kwama program has access to a <strong>memory bank</strong> consisting
      of a number of <strong>memory slots</strong>. Each memory slot can store
      a single integer. There are a fixed number of memory slots. Kwama machines
      with large amounts of memory are very expensive, so we'll work with a
      modest machine with only ten memory slots for now. Memory slots are the
      only memory or storage a Kwama program has access to. There is no way to
      store or retrieve data other than using memory slots.
      You may have heard of things called "strings", "arrays", "objects",
      "functions", or any other number of strange names. None of these things
      exist in the Kwama language. The ten memory slots in our machine are
      numbered 0 through 9:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
      </div>

      <p>
        When the machine starts, the value in each slot is 0.
        When the machine stops, the value of each slot will be displayed on the screen.
        You can see the results of your program by looking at the value of the slot
        where the program stored its result.
      </p>

      <h2>Arguments</h2>

      <p>
        There are two main types of arguments in the Kwama language. One of them
        is for referencing memory slots. A memory slot is referred to by prefixing
        its number with an at sign (<span class="code">@</span>). For example,
        an argument that references memory slot 5 would be written
        <span class="code">@5</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other main type of argument is the <strong>literal</strong>. A literal
        argument is literally the value of a number. Literal arguments are written
        by prefixing the numeric value with a dollar sign (<span class="code">$</span>).
        For example, an argument that has the literal value 7 would be written
        <span class="code">$7</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ensure that you can immediately recall that <span class="code">@3</span>
        means "memory slot 3" and <span class="code">$9</span> means "the value 9"
        whenever you see these used.
      </p>

      <h2>The <span class="code">add</span> instruction</h2>

      <p>
        The <span class="code">add</span> instruction (introduced using the opcode
        <span class="code">add</span>) takes two arguments. The first argument is
        the <strong>destination</strong> and the second argument is the
        <strong>source</strong>. When an <span class="code">add</span> instruction
        is executed, the sum of the destination and the source will be stored
        in the destination. For example, in this instruction:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @3 $5
      </div>

      <p>
        The first argument, <span class="code">@3</span>, is the destination.
        The second argument, <span class="code">$5</span> is the source.
        This instruction will compute the sum of <span class="code">@3</span> and
        <span class="code">$5</span> and store the result in <span class="code">@3</span>.
        This is a long-winded way of saying that this instruction effectively adds
        5 to the value of memory slot 3. Try this example in the Kwama intpreter
        by entering the instruction above and pressing the Run button. At the
        bottom of the screen you should see the message "memory slot 3 has the value 5"
        indicating that the instruction was successful. Modify this example to
        instead add 2 to memory slot 0 and run the program to verify that it
        worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, consider this instruction:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add $5 @3
      </div>

      <p>
        Do not attempt to run this instruction yet. Notice that this instruction
        is the same as the previous one except that the arguments were reversed.
        The original instruction we discussed above added 5 to memory slot 3; what
        does this new instruction do now that the arguments were reversed?
        The destination is now the literal 5, but this doesn't make sense because
        the <span class="code">add</span> instruction modifies its destination.
        While it's perfectly reasonable to modify a memory slot, it does not make
        sense to modify a literal. One cannot change the value of 5, it will
        always be 5. Because <span class="code">$5</span> is the literal value 5
        and not a memory slot <strong>it cannot be modified</strong>. This code
        is actually illegal. Try running it now and you will get an error message.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 1a</h3>

      <p>
        Write a program that results in memory slot 5 having the value 9.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 1b</h3>

      <p>
        Write a program that results in memory slot 9 having the value 5.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 1c</h3>

      <p>
        Write a program that results in both:
        <ul>
          <li>memory slot 5 having the value 9</li>
          <li>memory slot 9 having the value 5</li>
        </ul>
        This program will require two lines.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 2</h3>

      <p>
        Start with this program:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @4 $5
      </div>

      <p>
        Add a second line so that the program results in memory slot 4
        having the value 11. <strong>Do not modify or delete the first line
          provided above.</strong> Your program must execute the first line
          that was provided, then a second line you have written, such that memory slot 4 ends
          with the value 11.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 2a</h3>

      <p>
        Start with this program:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @7 $3
      </div>

      <p>
        Add a second line so that the program results in memory slot 5
        having the value 3 <strong>without using any literals in the second
        line</strong>. As before, you may not modify or delete the first line.
        The values of memory slots other than 5 at the end of your program do
        not matter.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 2b</h3>

      <p>
        Start with this program:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @1 $4<br>
        add @2 $5
      </div>

      <p>
        Add a third and fourth line so that the program results in memory slot 3
        having the value 9 <strong>without using any literals in the third
        or fourth lines</strong>. As before, you may not modify or delete the first or second line.
        The values of memory slots other than 3 at the end of your program do
        not matter.
      </p>

      <h2>The <span class="code">jmp</span> instruction and labels</h2>

      <p>
      Labels were mentioned briefly above and will finally be properly introduced.
      The <span class="code">jmp</span> instruction allows you to jump to
      a different spot in your program and continue running from there. Locations
      that can be jumped to are marked with a label. Every label is defined with
      a unique numeric ID (the number that appears after the colon). This same
      number is provided as the single argument to the <span class="code">jmp</span>
      instruction to select the target label. Because the label ID is neither a literal nor a memory slot,
      we do not use <span class="code">$</span> or <span class="code">@</span>
      as a prefix but instead use <span class="code">L</span> for label. For example:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @0 $5 <br>
        jmp L4 <br>
        add @1 $6 <br>
        :4 <br>
        add @2 $7
      </div>

      <p>
        The <span class="code">jmp</span> instruction jumps to label <span class="code">L4</span>,
        effectively skipping the instruction that would otherwise add 6 to memory slot 1. Run
        this program and observe the result. Remove the <span class="code">jmp</span> instruction
        and observe the difference in behavior. Notice that the presence of the label alone does
        not influence the program, it is only the <span class="code">jmp</span> instruction that
        performs an action. Labels are merely bookmarks.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 3</h3>

      <div class="code">
        :5 <br>
        add @0 $7 <br>
        :2 <br>
        add @1 $7 <br>
        :9 <br>
        add @2 $7 <br>
        :3 <br>
        add @3 $7 <br>
        :6 <br>
        add @4 $7
      </div>

      <p>
        Modify this program by inserting <span class="code">jmp</span>
        instructions so that the result is that memory slots 0, 2, and 4 each have
        the value 7 and all other memory slots have the value 0. Do not make
        any changes except to insert <span class="code">jmp</span> instructions wherever you want.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 4</h3>

      <div class="code">
        :1 <br>
        jmp L1
      </div>

      <p>
        What do you think will happen if you run this code? Try it.
      </p>

      <h2>The <span class="code">cmp</span> instruction</h2>

      <p>
        The <span class="code">cmp</span> instruction takes two arguments
        and compares them. It does not modify any memory; instead the
        <span class="code">cmp</span> instruction modifies a special part
        of the machine that you cannot directly access called the <strong>
        comparison flag</strong>. This is a hidden value within the machine
        that stores the result of the last <span class="code">cmp</span>
        instruction. If both arguments are equal the comparison flag will be
        set to 0. If the first argument is less than the second argument,
        the comparison flag will be set to -1, and if the first argument greater
        than the second argument, the comparison flag will be set to 1. For example:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        cmp $4 $4 <span class="plain">(equal, comparison flag will be 0)</span> <br>
        cmp $4 $5 <span class="plain">(less, comparison flag will be -1)</span> <br>
        cmp $5 $4 <span class="plain">(greater, comparison flag will be 1)</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        The <span class="code">cmp</span> instruction does not do anything except change the
        value of the comparison flag.
        The value of the comparison flag at the end of your program is printed
        under the list of memory slots. You may be wondering what the use of this
        instruction is if all it does is set the comparison flag, which you cannot
        access. The answer is that certain other instructions depend on the value
        of the comparison flag for their behavior. We will discuss such an
        instruction next.
      </p>

      <h2>The <span class="code">jne</span> instruction</h2>

      <p>
        The <span class="code">jne</span> is a sibling of the <span class="code">jmp</span>
        instruction. The difference is that instead of blindly jumping wherever it is told,
        it will instead "<strong>j</strong>ump if <strong>n</strong>ot <strong>e</strong>qual".
        The "not equal" here refers to the value of the comparison flag; <span class="code">jne</span>
        will jump only if the last comparison (<span class="code">cmp</span> instruction) was not equal
        (the comparison flag is not 0); otherwise
        it will be ignored completely. This is the first instruction that allows decision-making. We
        can base the decision to jump or not on a comparison. This is the last new instruction that is
        strictly necessary in order to make the language essentially capable of computing anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        A comparison that is never equal followed by a <span class="code">jne</span> instruction
        is essentially identical to a <span class="code">jmp</span> instruction, e.g.:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        :9 <br>
        cmp $3 $7 <br>
        jne L9
      </div>

      <p>
        Because the comparison between 3 and 7 will never be equal, the comparison flag will never
        be 0 when the <span class="code">jne</span> instruction runs, so it will always jump. This
        program is thus identical in behavior to:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        :9 <br>
        jmp L9
      </div>

      <p>
        The opposite is also true if a <span class="code">jne</span> instruction
        is preceded by a comparison that is always equal, e.g.:
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        :9 <br>
        cmp $7 $7 <br>
        jne L9
      </div>

      <p>
        The jump will never be taken here because the comparison flag will always be 0.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 5</h3>

      <p>
        Below is the code example used at the very beginning of this document.
        You have now seen every instruction it requires except for <span class="code">sub</span>
        which simply performs subtraction (<span class="code">sub @0 $1</span> subtracts one from memory slot 0):
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        add @0 $10 <br>
        :0 <br>
        add @1 $3 <br>
        sub @0 $1 <br>
        cmp @0 $0 <br>
        jne L0
      </div>

      <p>
        What is the output when you run this program? How does it work? What happens
        if you use different values in place of <span class="code">$10</span>
        and <span class="code">$3</span>? What operation does this code perform?
      </p>
<!--
      <p>
        As an example of a practical use of the <span class="code">jne</span> instruction,
        we will implement multiplication. The language does not have an instruction that
        performs multiplication, but multiplication is merely repeated addition and the
        <span class="code">jne</span> instruction affords the power to control repetition:
        (this example makes use of <strong>comments</strong> which are lines that start with
        a pound sign and have no effect on the program)
      </p>

      <div class="code">
        # We will use @0 and @1 to <br>
        # store the numbers that <br>
        # we want to multiply. The <br>
        # result will go in @2. <br>
 <br>
        # Set inputs <br>
        add @0 $5 <br>
        add @1 $3 <br>
 <br>
        # Add @1 to @2 a total <br>
        # of @0 times <br>
        :0 <br>
        cmp @0 $0 <br>
        jne L1 <br>
        jmp L3 <br>
        :1 <br>
        add @2 @1 <br>
        add @0 $-1 <br>
        jmp L0 <br>
        :3 <br>
        # The end.
      </div>

      <p>
        After this program runs, memory slot 2 will contain 15. This is the product
        of 5 and 3, which are the values that the program uses from memory slots
        0 and 1. If you change this 5 to a 6 the result in memory slot 2 will change
        to 18, etc. Study this program line by line, imagining how it acts at each step.
        (Note that the use of <span class="code">$-1</span> is simply the value negative one.)
        This is the first non-trivial program we have seen so this may take some time.
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise 5</h3>

      <p>
        Using the rules we have established so far, write out the entire state of the machine
        as each line of the multiplication example executes (the same state that is printed at
        the end of the program, except for every step of execution instead of just the final step).
        As a start:
        <ol>
          <li>We start with a clean slate. All memory slots are zero.</li>
          <li>Execute <span class="code">add @0 $5</span></li>
          <li>Now memory slot 0 is 5, all other memory slots are still 0</li>
          <li>Execute <span class="code">add @1 $3</span></li>
          <li>Now memory slot 0 is 5, memory slot 1 is 3, and all other memory slots are still 0</li>
          <li>Execute <span class="code">cmp @0 $0</span></li>
          <li>Now the comparison flag is 1 because 5 is greater than 0</li>
          <li>Execute <span class="code">jne L1</span> (comparison flag is not zero so jump is taken)</li>
          <li>We have now jumped to <span class="code">:1</span></li>
          <li>Execute <span class="code">add @2 @1</span></li>
          <li>Now memory slot 0 is 5, memory slot 1 is 3, and memory slot 2 is 3</li>
          <li>Execute <span class="code">add @0 $-1</span></li>
